        <h3 class="lb-heading">Langley - The Leader of the 9th Agency</h3>
        <p class="lb-text">
          The current leader of the 9th Agency. The 9th Agency isn't big, but it
          is on the same administration level as FAC, and directly under
          Paradeisos. It is in charge of the DisCity's intelligence spies. The
          subject is known as a "cold-blooded Melanosuchus" and a "lapdog" due
          to the brutality, and has a bad reputation. She was suspected of
          murdering the peace negotiator and disobeying orders, seriously
          endangering the safety of the city-state. She was sent to court but
          escaped from punishment for unknown reasons. Still a high-rank
          official who holds the DisCity's core political secrets to this day.

        <h3 class="lb-heading">Cabernet - The Noble Cannibal</h3>
        <p class="lb-text">
          The lady of the Franc family in Eastside, who enjoys wealth and
          status, has been pampered since childhood and is extremely picky about
          the things she eats. In order to satisfy her, the family spared no
          expense in finding all the ingredients she wanted... Several chefs and
          other people have disappeared in the subject's mansion. She admitted
          to this, acknowledging that she restricted their freedom, but claimed
          that she was only "cultivating" them.

        <h3 class="lb-heading">Eriene - The CEO of Quinn Group</h3>
        <p class="lb-text">
          Owned under the subject's name, Quinn has engaged in illegal business
          operations and hostile takeovers in multiple sectors in the DisCity as
          well as attempted to break into the Hypercube industry, undermining
          the foundation of the DisCity's economy. Investigation by the 9th
          Agency also suggests that Quinn has deep-rooted relations with foreign
          power Campbell family. Considering that Quinn's president Eirene has a
          record of colluding with desert bandits, her intentional concealment
          of her Sinner identity may suggest a more ambitious intention. Special
          supervision is therefore required as her true purpose is being further
          investigated.

        <h3 class="lb-heading">Oak Casket - The Faithful Nun</h3>
        <p class="lb-text">
          Oak Casket is an underground information broker who uses Romanesque
          Hall as a front. She commits brutal murders, and sells classified
          information she has collected to violent gangs, which has brought
          about many large conflicts resulting in heavy casualties; she also
          disrupts the balance of power in Syndicate by using confidential
          information to stir up frictions between the various factions in the
          region. Several cases of trafficking are also linked to Oak Casket.
          It's unclear where she obtained the trafficked products (later on, by
          her own admission, she obtained some of the products herself). This is
          a serious crime that has disastrous ramifications; she must be
          detained immediately.
